 /*
  * How to get the private key:
  * ===========================
  *
  * First, generate a public/private key pair.
  * On Mac OS, you can directly open a terminal.
  * On Windows, you first need to install OpenSSL:
  * https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
  *
  * Enter these commands in a terminal to generate your keys:
  * openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ec_private.pem
  * openssl ec -in ec_private.pem -pubout -out ec_public.pem
  *
  * The public key is needed on the DCD Hub to create a new thing.
  * The corresponding private key is needed here.
  * Use the following command to convert your key to hex digits:
  * openssl ec -in ec_private.pem -noout -text
  *
  * Copy the priv: part.
  * The key should be exactly 32 pairs of hex digits long.
  * If it's longer and starts with "00:" delete the "00:". If
  * it's shorter add "00:" to the beginning.
